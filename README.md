## Course Description

Master JavaScript by learning and writing real-world applications. This course continues
where the introductory JavaScript programming language left off. Students use a variety
of JavaScript programming strategies to solve complex problems. Topics include object-oriented
programming concepts, unit testing, asynchronous executions, files and streams, lambda
expressions, and JavaScript module bundlers. Problem solving using advanced JavaScript techniques
is emphasized. GitHub is used to host and share coding projects.

Prerequisite: WEB 231

## Repository Overview

Carefully read the assigned chapters, videos, and narrative I've included under each exercise and assignment.

Most exercises and assignments have runnable sample code so you can visually see the concept "in action."  Assignments are broken into "milestones" and each "milestone" builds on the last.

Approach every week from top-to-bottom and do not move to the next assignment/exercise without fully understanding the previous.

```bash
